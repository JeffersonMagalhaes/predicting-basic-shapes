# Basic Shapes

# Shape Prediction Project

This project demonstrates my data science knowledge and skills, developed as part of my journey to earn a professional degree in data science from HarvardX. The goal of this project is to predict basic shapes (triangles, squares, and circles) from a set of images. Each image contains one shape, and the task is to correctly identify the shape.

## Introduction

In this project, I applied various data science techniques to build a model that can accurately predict the shape contained in an image. This task involves image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate data science skills and knowledge.
- Predict basic shapes (triangles, squares, and circles) from images.
- Achieve a high level of accuracy in shape prediction.

## Data

The dataset consists of images, each containing one of three basic shapes: triangle, square, or circle. The images are labeled with the correct shape.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized and normalized.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Key features from the images were extracted using techniques such as edge detection and contour analysis.
3. **Model Building**: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.
4. **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting the shapes. Detailed results and analysis are available in the [Results](results.md) section.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates my ability to apply data science techniques to solve a practical problem. The model can accurately predict basic shapes from images, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning.
